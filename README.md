Hey there! 

I go by Tim/Timmy and I'm an SJSU graduate living in the Bay Area looking to learn more about the new technologies used in the CS/SE field today! 
I'm hoping to expand my knowledge and skillsets on a daily basis and I am open to hearing about opportunities that could prove interesting.

Recently I picked up projects with Python and GCP to learn more about how cloud properties work as well as to experiment with MySQL. Right now however, I am working towards
learning the MEAN stack and hope to create fascinating projects with it!
